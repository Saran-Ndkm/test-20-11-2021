Overall idea

Earlier, while developing and deploying software applications, companies had been facing common issues like network attacks, data leaks, poor network connectivity, time-consuming processes in building network topologies, and inadequate diversion of network traffic.With this going on, Microsoft saved the day, right on time Microsoft Azure addressed these issues and launched Azure Virtual Network, which helped companies communicate securely with other networks and maintain a cost-efficient cloud environment. Thus, adding another feather to Microsoftâ€™s hat.

What Is Azure Virtual Network?

An Azure Virtual Network (VNet) is a network or environment that can be used to run VMs and applications in the cloud.
When it is created, the services and Virtual Machines within the Azure network interact securely with each other.
Advantages of Using Azure Virtual Network
Some of the major advantages of using Microsoft Azure VNet are as follows:
It provides an isolated environment for your applications
A subnet in a VNet can access the public internet by default
We can easily direct traffic from resources
It is a highly secure network
It has high network connectivity
It builds sophisticated network topologies in a simple manner
Moving on, let's have a look at the components of Azure VNet.
 

Components of Azure VNet

Azure networking components provide a wide range of functionalities that can help companies build efficient cloud applications that meet their requirements.
The components of Azure Networking are listed below, and we have explained each of these components in a detailed manner:
Subnets
Network Security Groups
